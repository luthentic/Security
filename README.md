 1. [DDoS](#ddos)



---

## DDos:
 - A DoS attack is a cyber attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
 - This is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.
 - In essence, this forces the targeted computer or network to reset, or consumes its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service.

## DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack:
- A DDoS attack is an amplification of a DoS attack, where the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources â€“ potentially hundreds of thousands or more.
- This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.
- As a result, these attacks can cause serious disruptions of network services and resources.
