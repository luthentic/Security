## Vulnerabilities:
- Sotware Bugs
- Misconfigured Software
- Improperly Protected Network Devices
- Missing Security Patches

Threat + No Vulneralities = Zero Risk 
No Threat + Vulneralities = Zero Risk

## DDos:
 - A DoS attack is a cyber attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
 - This is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.
 - In essence, this forces the targeted computer or network to reset, or consumes its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service.

## DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack:
- A DDoS attack is an amplification of a DoS attack, where the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources â€“ potentially hundreds of thousands or more.
- This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.
- As a result, these attacks can cause serious disruptions of network services and resources.

## MITM:
 - A MITM attack is a type of cyber attack where a malicious actor inserts themselves into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying to send to each other.
 - The attacker intercepts, relays and possibly alters the communication without the knowledge of the two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.
 - One common method of a MITM attack involves distributing malware which provides the attacker with access to a victimâ€™s device. The attacker can then install software to process all of the victimâ€™s information.
 - MITM attacks can target communication at any level, from Wi-Fi connections to more application-specific forms, such as HTTP or HTTPS sessions.
 - These attacks can lead to serious consequences, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, loss of data integrity, or theft of personal information.

## Phishing:
 - Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves tricking the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need â€” a request from their bank, for instance, or a note from someone in their company â€” and clicking a link or downloading an attachment.
 - The attacker, disguised as a trusted entity, tricks a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.
 - The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
 - An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.
 - Furthermore, phishing is often used to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced persistent threat (APT) event.

## Whale Phishing Attack:
 - Whale phishing, also known as whaling, is a specific type of phishing attack that targets high-profile employees, such as the CEO or CFO, in order to steal sensitive information from a company. These high-profile individuals are referred to as â€˜whales,â€™ hence the name.
 - The attackers often spend considerable time profiling the target to create a sophisticated attack.
 - Whaling emails and websites are highly customized and personalized, and they often include the targetâ€™s name, job title, and other relevant information to make the attack more convincing.
 - The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue, which is likely to trick the recipient into responding.
 - Whaling attacks are usually more difficult to detect because they donâ€™t contain a malicious link or attachment, but aim to trick the victim into divulging sensitive information, often through a fake website.

## Spear-phishing attacks: 
 - Whale spear-phishing is a more targeted version of phishing. Itâ€™s a cyber attack that is specifically aimed at high-profile targets like senior executives (the â€˜whalesâ€™) within a business or other organization.
 - The attacker spends considerable time gathering specific personal and professional information about the target to make the attack more credible.
 - The goal of a whale spear-phishing attack is often to trick the executive into revealing sensitive company information, such as financial details, employee data, or access credentials.

## Randsomeware: 
 - Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that prevents you from accessing your computer files, systems, or networks and demands you pay a ransom for their return.
Ransomw are attacks can cause significant data loss and financial damage.
 - The attacker usually demands the ransom in a form of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, to maintain anonymity.
 - There are different types of ransomware, including scareware, screen lockers, and encryption ransomware.
 - Ransomware can be spread through email attachments, infected software apps, infected external storage devices, and compromised websites, though a majority are spread through phishing emails.

## Password Attack:
 - A password attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tries to gain unauthorized access to a system or network by cracking the passwords.
 - Brute-Force Attack: In this type of attack, the attacker tries all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found. This can be time-consuming but is guaranteed to find the password eventually.
 - Dictionary Attack: This is a method of breaking a password by trying all the words in a pre-arranged listing, typically derived from a list of words such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack).
 - Keylogger Attack: This involves the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a user in order to capture the userâ€™s password.
 - Phishing: The attacker tricks the user into revealing their password. This is often done through deceptive email and websites.
 - Rainbow Table Attack: A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. These tables allow attackers to reverse a password hash to its original password.

## Security Frameworks:

A cybersecurity framework is a set of guidelines designed to help organizations mitigate cybersecurity risks. It provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks and protecting valuable information assets.

- ISO 27000 series:
